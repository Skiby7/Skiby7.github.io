When working on multiple projects or you have a nice setup, it is useful to backup the entire boot drive in a `.img` file either to restore a perfectly working environment (for example after a drive failure or a catastrophic update ðŸ™ƒ) or to switch between Raspberry projects using the same SD card (beware SD wearing).
Here's how to do it:

>**Note**: *replace /dev/sda with the drive you want to backup/restore!*

```bash
# Backup
sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/sda of=PiOS.img

# Restore
sudo dd bs=4M if=PiOS.img of=/dev/sda

```

If you want to use compressed images (recommended):

```bash
# Backup
sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/sda | gzip > PiOS.img.gz

# Restore
gunzip --stdout PiOS.img.gz | sudo dd bs=4M of=/dev/sda
```
